Mahoosuc Mountain Search and Rescue will be hosting the 2017 
MASAR conference in Newry at the Hurricane Island Outward Bound 
Newry Mountain Center on Saturday May 20th.

__[Jump to tickets](#tickets)__

This training will focus on a realistic approach to real world searches. The day will begin with workshops and culminate in a complex field exercise.

In groups that participants select according to their previous training and experience, we will review the practical skills needed for efficient and effective search and rescue. Prior to the field exercise, workshops will be conducted, topics to include:

- Basic and advanced grid searches, using compass, GPS, smartphone apps
- Leadership and communication (recording, tracking and transferring medical information, multi-team response considerations, and efficient, collaborative decision making in the field)
- Management of clues and evidence
- Choosing resources: personal gear, team equipment, etc.
- Patient packaging for carry if varying terrain, short haul or air evacuation.

A debrief and consolidation of learnings will follow dinner.

The mock SAR will be will be held regardless of weather.Â Come prepared as you would for an actual search in the foothills in mid-May (consult the [MASAR Recommended Minimum Personal Equipment List](http://emainehosting.com/masar/MASAR_Documents/Ground%20Searcher%20Certification/STM-AppenD-Recommended-Min-Equip-List%20Rev5.pdf)). Expect to search for and transport a patient over rugged terrain in whatever weather we get.
